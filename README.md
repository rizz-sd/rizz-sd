- 👋 Hi, I’m Ritika Agrawal
- 👀 I’m interested in anything that involves development ( Language for development preference - Java {for backend}, TypeScript {For UI, clearly Angular's fan}, Python {for competetive programming}). I love to learn new things and sometimes self-sabotage my own projects to come up with how to implement the same thing but using some new technology.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to give to developer's community by contributing in Open source projects and also really looking for a job where I can meet more developers and work on some really exciting projects.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on new technologies!
- 📫 Just mail me at agrawalritika1811@gmail.com and I will get back to you!
- 😄 Pronouns: Coder/geek
- ⚡ Fun fact: Despite being a geek, I am actually really fun to be around.
